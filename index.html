<h1>All About My Cats</h1> 

<p>I currently have three beautiful cats. They are named Jiji, David, and Augustus(Auggie). Jiji is a beautiful, goregous, svelt 3-year old little lady. David is a round, 2-year old, happy-go-lucky orange long-haired tabby. Augustus is my new baby, and he is almost a year old! He is a gray tabby, and an asbolute terrorist. I love my cats, and I don't know what I would do without them. The picture below is a picture of the three of them. </p>

<h2>Fun Facts About My Cats</h2>
    
<p>My cats are interesting, and they have tons of weird quirks and fun facts! I think David is the most intersting, as he has something called
    <a href="https://vetmed.tamu.edu/news/pet-talk/wobbly-cat-syndrome/">Wobbly Cat Syndrome.</a> This means that he is a little different from other cats. Here are some of his weird quirks: </p>

<ol>
<li>He wobbles everywhere he goes, especially with his head.</li>
<li>He needs an XL food mat because his coordination is challenged.</li>
<li>He often runs into things because he doesn't have depth perception.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Wrapping Things Up</h2>

<p>If you want to know more about cats in general,
<a href="https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/p/all-about-cats.html"> this website</a> has a lot of wonderful information about our favorite felines. In the meantime, to close this out, here is a cheatsheet for getting to know my cats:</p>
